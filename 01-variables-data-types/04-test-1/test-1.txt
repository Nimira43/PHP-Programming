Test 1
Answer each question in your own words or with code.
----------------------------------------------------

SECTION A — PHP TAGS, PRINTING & COMMENTS
1. Write the correct PHP opening tag.
2. What is the difference between echo and print? Give two differences.

3. Write a single‑line comment and a multi‑line comment in PHP.
4. Why is it common to omit the closing ?> tag in pure PHP files?

SECTION B — VARIABLES
5. Write three valid PHP variable names and one invalid one. Explain why the invalid one fails.
6. What is the difference between $name and $Name in PHP?
7. Create three variables: $title, $year, and $pi, and echo them inside HTML.

SECTION C — DATA TYPES
8. For each of the following values, state the PHP data type:
  a) "Hello"
  b) 42
  c) 3.14
  d) true
  e) ['a', 'b', 'c']
  f) new stdClass()
  g) null

9. What does var_dump() show that echo does not?
10. What does gettype() return?

SECTION D — ARRAYS
11. Create an array of three animals and echo the second one.
12. What is the difference between var_dump($array) and print_r($array)?

SECTION E — OBJECTS
13. Create a stdClass object called $grades with two properties: Alice and Bob. Give Alice 90 and Bob 72.
14. Echo Bob’s grade.

SECTION F — NULL
15. Create a variable set to null and explain what happens when you echo it.

SECTION G — RESOURCES
16. What does fopen() return? Explain in your own words.
17. Why does echo $file output something like Resource id #3?
18. Write code that reads the contents of test.txt using file_get_contents().

SECTION H — THE MIND GRENADE (STRING CONCATENATION)
19. Create two variables:

  $firstName = "Lenny";
  $lastName = "The Cat";

Then output:

  Lenny The Cat

BUT you must do it using string concatenation, not interpolation.

(You’ll need the . operator — and yes, this is the part that nudges you into the next chapter.)

SECTION I — BONUS
20. Explain why <?= print_r($value) ?> sometimes outputs a 1 at the end.
